You are very welcome to contribute to `blaqkube/mysql-operator`. If you plan to
do so, you will need some tools. This section provides details about it.

## Go

The operator is written in Go, you can get it from the
[downloads](https://golang.org/dl/) page.

## operator-sdk

This operator relies on
[operator-framework/operator-sdk](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk).
You will very likely need it. Installing `operator-sdk` is usually as simple as:

- downloading the executable from the
  [release page](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/releases);
- making sure you can execute the file
- adding the file to your `PATH`

To use `operator-sdk`, you might need to set `GOROOT` to workaround
[Issue #1480](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/issues/1480) like below:

```shell
export GOROOT=$(go env GOROOT)
```

> Note: To know more about operator-sdk and how to install it, see
> [Operator SDK documentation](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs)
