title: Installation
---

To install the `mysql-operator` from blaqkube, you can perform a manual
installation from the repository or use the Operator Lifecycle Manager. The
later option is the preferred way to proceed as it will not only proceed
with the installation but will also help with upgrading the tool later on.

## Installation with Operator Lifecycle Manager

OLM is the preferred way to install `blaqkube/mysql-operator`. That is because,
not only OLM can install the operator but it also manages its lifecycle as the
name suggests.

The simplest way to install OLM on your cluster is:

- [Install the Operator SDK CLI](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/install-operator-sdk/)
- Make sure your can access a Kubernetes cluster with cluster admin role
- Run `operator-sdk olm` like below

```shell
operator-sdk olm install
operator-sdk olm status
```

> Note: In order for `blaqkube/mysql-operator` to update correctly, you should
> use OLM 0.15+. This is due to issue
> [#1347](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager/issues/1347)


## Manual Installation

Manual installation consists in cloning the git repository first:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/blaqkube/mysql-operator.git
cd mysql-operator
```

Once done, you should install the CRDs like below:

```shell
cd $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/deploy/crds
kubectl apply -f mysql.blaqkube.io_backups_crd.yaml
kubectl apply -f mysql.blaqkube.io_stores_crd.yaml
kubectl apply -f mysql.blaqkube.io_instances_crd.yaml
```
