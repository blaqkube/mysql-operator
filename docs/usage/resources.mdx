`blaqkube/mysql-operator` comes with a number of resources to manage your
mysql instances.

## The `Store` resource

Stores are used to keep backups. For now, only S3 and S3 compatible stores
are available.


```yaml
apiVersion: mysql.blaqkube.io/v1alpha1
kind: Store
metadata:
  name: mybackupstore
spec:
  backend: s3
  s3access:
    bucket: mybucket
    credentials:
      aws_access_key_id: AKIAXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
      aws_secret_access_key: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
      region: us-east-1
    path: /location
```
