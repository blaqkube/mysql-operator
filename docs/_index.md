# Getting started

blaqkube MySQL operator provides a set of extensions for Kubernetes to manage
community-based MySQL instances. Built with the
[Operator Framework](https://github.com/operator-framework), it can be managed
by the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM).

Once installed, you should be able, from a simple manifest, to:

- Create a MySQL instance 👌
- Add databases to the newly created instance 🏋
- Add new users 🎅 to a MySQL instance
- Grant access 🕳 to databases for a user
- Create a backup store 💯 in S3 and GCP storage
- Generate a backup in the store 💥
- Create a new instance from a backup ❤

To use the MySQL operator, check the [Installation](/users/installation.md)
section as well as the [Resources](/users/resources.md). After that, you are
ready 🚀
