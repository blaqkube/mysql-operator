blaqkube MySQL operator provides a set of extensions for Kubernetes to manage
community-based MySQL instances. Built with the
[Operator Framework](https://github.com/operator-framework), it can be managed
by the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM).

Once installed, you should be able, from a simple manifest, to:

- Create a MySQL instance 👌
- Add databases to the newly created instance 🏋
- Add new users and grant accesses to databases 🎅
- Create a backup store 💯
- Generate a backup in the store 💥
- Automate daily backups 🤘
- Create a new instance from a backup ❤

To use the MySQL operator, check the [Installation](/usage/installation)
section as well as the [Resource](/usage/resources). After that, you are
ready 🚀
